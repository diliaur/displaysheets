Building a small wordpress plugin to port data in from a google sheet, display it nicely, and allow filtration by column. Test case is the scholarships page for my place of work. Eventually the plugin will be generalized (how this will look conceptually will be addressed at some point in the future).

Libraries explored or used:
- [Tabletop.js](https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop)
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
- [List JS](listjs.com) (to check out)
